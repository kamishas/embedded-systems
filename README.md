# BeagleBone Traffic Signal Simulation

This repository contains code for simulating traffic signals using a BeagleBone device. The `traffic_signal.c` file is designed to demonstrate control of traffic lights in a simulated environment, intended for educational purposes or for use in small-scale traffic management projects.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to set up and run the traffic signal simulation on your BeagleBone. The code is developed and tested for the BeagleBone platform, utilizing its GPIO pins to control real or simulated traffic lights.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A BeagleBone Black or similar BeagleBone model.
- An SD card with a compatible Debian OS installed.
- Basic tools for compiling C programs (GCC, Make).

### Hardware Setup

Connect LED lights or other indicative hardware to the GPIO pins of the BeagleBone to represent traffic lights. Ensure each light is correctly connected to designated GPIO pins configured in the `traffic_signal.c` file.

### Software Setup




This README provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the traffic signal simulation on a BeagleBone device, making it accessible for those with basic hardware and software skills. Adjust the GPIO pin configuration and logic in the source code as needed to match your specific setup and educational objectives.
